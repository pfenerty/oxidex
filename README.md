# OCIDex

**A metadata catalog for your software supply chain.**

OCIDex ingests [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/) SBOMs, links them to the software artifacts they describe, and gives you a searchable inventory of every component, version, and license across your entire portfolio — with a changelog that shows exactly what changed between releases.

## Features

- **SBOM Ingestion** — POST a CycloneDX JSON document and OCIDex validates, parses, and stores it with full component and dependency graph data.
- **Artifact Tracking** — SBOMs are grouped by artifact (container image, library, application). Browse the full version history of any artifact.
- **Changelog** — See exactly which components were added, removed, or changed between any two SBOMs for an artifact.
- **SBOM Diffing** — Pick any two SBOMs across any artifacts and compare them side by side.
- **Component Search** — Find any package by name, group, or type across all ingested SBOMs. See which artifacts use it and how many versions exist.
- **License Inventory** — Every license found across your SBOMs in one place, categorized as permissive, weak-copyleft, or copyleft, with per-artifact summaries.
- **Enrichment Pipeline** — After ingestion, background workers enrich SBOMs with additional data. The built-in OCI metadata enricher pulls image labels, architecture, and build info directly from container registries.
- **OpenAPI Documentation** — The API spec is generated from code at startup via [huma](https://huma.rocks/). Browse it at `/docs`.

## Quick Start

### With Docker Compose

The fastest way to get a running instance with seed data:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pfenerty/ocidex.git
cd ocidex
docker compose up -d
```

This starts PostgreSQL, the OCIDex API server (port 8080), and the web frontend (port 3000).

To populate it with real-world SBOMs from public container images:

```sh
# Requires oras, syft, and curl — available in the Flox dev environment
flox activate -- ./scripts/seed.sh
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### From Source

OCIDex uses [Flox](https://flox.dev/) to manage its development environment (Go, Node, npm, oras, syft, and other tools).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pfenerty/ocidex.git
cd ocidex
flox activate

# Install Go tools (sqlc, golangci-lint)
make init

# Start PostgreSQL (via docker-compose, or provide your own)
docker compose up -d postgres

# Configure
cp .env.example .env   # edit DATABASE_URL if needed

# Run migrations and build
make migrate-up
make build
make frontend

# Start the server
./bin/ocidex
```

The API serves on `:8080` by default. For frontend development with hot reload:

```sh
make frontend-dev   # Vite dev server on :3000, proxies /api/* to :8080
```

### Ingest Your First SBOM

Generate an SBOM with [syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft) and send it to OCIDex:

```sh
syft registry:docker.io/library/nginx:latest -o cyclonedx-json | \
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/sbom \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d @-
```
